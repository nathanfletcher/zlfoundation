            <p>Zoomlion Foundation (ZLF) is the Corporate Social Responsibility wing of the Jospong Group of Companies.</p>
            <p>Since its inception in 1995, the Jospong/Zoomlion Group of Companies have given donations to many individuals
                and institutions to support a wide range of initiatives. To formalize its corporate social responsibility
                role for the Jospong/Zoomlion Group of Companies, the Zoomlion Foundation was legally registered as an independent
                entity with its own Board of Directors in July 2014.</p>
            <h5>VISION</h5>
            <p>Our vision is for all people in Ghana to attain excellent environmental sanitation with improved socio-economic transformation.</p>

            <h5>MISSION</h5>
            <p>Our mission is to inspire the youth to champion good environmental and sanitary practices and also invest in communities.</p>

            <h5>CORE VALUES</h5>
            Our foundation's core values:
            <ul>
            <li>Good stewardship - we believe in homegrown solutions as well as taking responsibility for the sustainable development of communities we work in.</li>
            <li>Caring - we care a lot about the communities we work in.</li>
            <li>Response - we respond to the emergency needs of our people.</li>
            <li>Environmentally-friendly - we care a lot about the environment.</li>
            <li>Meeting needs - we strategically respond to the needs of communities where it matters most.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 id="partners">Partnership Approach</h5>
            <p>Zoomlion Foundation has noted that a collaborative multi-stakeholder approach is vital to maintaining and
                replicating the success of initiatives such as Zoomkids Club, which is aimed at inculcating good
                sanitary habits into children. To achieve behavioural change with regard to environmental sanitation in
                Ghana, neither Zoomlion Foundation, the government nor civil societies alone can make it happen.</p>
            <p>
                The Foundation plans to scale up the number of clubs from the current 400 to 1000 and would like to
                partner with civil society organizations, donor agencies and government institutions to work together
                to create a critical mass of young Ghanaians who inspire attitudinal and behavioural change within the
                society.</p>
