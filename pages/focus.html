        <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
            <p>The foundation's first focal area is to provide support for the activities of the Zoomkids Club.
                The Zoomkids Club is the flagship project of Zoomlion Foundation. It is made up of environmental
                sanitation clubs operating in schools across the country. The aim of the Zoomkids Project is to
                facilitate the creation of social and environmental awareness and education among young people, as well
                as help them develop good sanitary habits. The Foundation believes that if children are conscientized
                early on the benefits of good sanitary practices and habits, those habits will become second nature to
                them and put them in positions where they could influence social behavioural changes in their families,
                schools and the community at large.</p><br>

            <h5>Other focal areas of the foundation</h5>
            <p>Each year based on our financial situation, Zoomlion Foundation would prioritize any of these three thematic areas:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Environmental Sanitation Management</li>
                <li>Social Support</li>
                <li>Livelihood Support</li>
            </ol>

            <h6>1) ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION MANAGEMENT</h6>
            <p>This includes:</p>
            <em>Support for water, sanitation and hygiene</em>
            <p>The Foundation will support basic infrastructure development related to water, sanitation and hygiene
                (W.A.S.H) activities/projects using simple innovative technologies. These projects will be done
                especially in communities where Zoomkids Club activities are vibrant.</p>

            <h6>2) SOCIAL SUPPORT</h6>
            <em>The specific areas for support are as follows:</em>
            <ul>
                <li>Education</li>
                <li>Under-resourced public institutions</li>
                <li>Emergency response in disaster situations.</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
            <li><em>Educational Support</em></li>
            <p>Zoomlion Foundation will provide grants towards payment of school fees for brilliant but needy students
                in senior high schools and tertiary institutions. Additionally, school teachers who double as Zoomkids
                Club Patrons may obtain scholarship assistance to pursue a postgraduate degree course at our African
                Institute of Sanitation and Waste Management (AISWAM-KNUST).</p>

            <li><em>Support to Under-resourced institutions</em></li>
            <p>Zoomlion will identify, partner and collaborate with institutions, non-governmental organizations and
                corporate entities to support under-resourced institutions like hospitals, prisons, schools for the
                disabled, orphanages, etc. The Foundation will also support some specific church activities.</p>

            <li><em>Emergency response</em></li>
            <p>In an unfortunate event of an epidemic outbreak such as cholera or a natural disaster in the contry,
                based on its financial situation, Zoomlion Foundation will join forces with institutions that share a
                common goal to provide the needed support.</p>
            </ol>
            <h6>3) LIVELIHOOD SUPPORT</h6>
            <em>Support for recycling initiatives</em>
            <p>The Foundation will support and/or partner with grassroots organizations that are transforming their
                economic lives through recycling initiatives.</p>
